## Analyzing of USA bikeshare system with python
In this project, i make a simple program make user can know some information about the USA bikeshare system.

## Libraries that i Used in this project:
**Numpy** : is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
        It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object,
        various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays,
        including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms,
        basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

**Pandas** : Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.
         It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.
         The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.
